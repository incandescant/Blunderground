== Blunderground

A WebOS application for navigating the London underground. Has a map and a tube
status viewer.

= To Do
* Handle back properly and fix stacking
* Do we need to store the processed "style" value in the model or can we do the
  processing in the template?
* Don't hard code the image size in the CSS, we just want device width/height here
* Remember last position on tube map
* Station finder
* Zoom to nearest station (get location from OSM)
* Handle rotation
